- data: 
the data sets.

- 1_prepare_counts_table: 
prepare and filter data structures

- 2_prepare_samples_table:
create the samples table for DESeq

- 3_quality_control:
run quality control (pca, cv, read density, read ecdf, matrix corr)

- 3_quality_control_w_deseq2:
run DESeq dispersions estimates, mean vs sd plot, PCA analyses per time point and strain

- 4_deseq__strain:
run DESeq contrasting strain (WT,A66)

- 4_deseq__time:
run DESeq contrasting time (0,15,40,90,180,300)

- 4_deseq__strain_vs_time_per_TimePoint__factor_TimeStrain
run DESeq contrasting the strain (WT,A66) for each time point. This uses a factor (0WT,15WT, 40WT, ..., 0A66, 15A66, 40A66, ..) as design formula. 

- 4_deseq__strain_vs_time_per_TimePoint_interaction_WaldTest:
run DESeq using strain + time + strain:time as design formula. The idea is to calculate the difference between A66 and WT along the time course.
Protocol: http://www.bioconductor.org/help/workflows/rnaseqGene/
Not sure our data can be used with this approach successfully. 

- 4_deseq__strain_vs_egf:
run DESeq contrasting the strain (WT,A66) for EGF condition (EGF, noEGF). This uses a factor (EGFWT,noEGFWT, EGFA66, noEGFA66) as design formula. 

- 5_clustering:
run pam clustering. Test of several k values.

- 6_compare_deseq_signif_miRNA_over_time:
compare DESeq2-based significant miRNA between time points

- 6_compare_deseq_signif_miRNA_vs_pca_loading:
compare DESeq2-based significant miRNA against PCA:PC2 loadings 
greater than a certain threshold. Calculate Venn diagram, and run 
PCA for the significant sets.

- 7_miRNA_timecourses:
generate time courses from the counts table. miRNA are plotted all together, all together with colour representing PAM clustering, or by 
median of each cluster time courses. Data are separated between WT, A66, and A66_noEGF. 
Additionally, time courses of DESeq2-based log2 fold change (lcf) are 
plotted using the three time-dependent DESeq2 experiments.
